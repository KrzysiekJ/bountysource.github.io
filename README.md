## Bountysource API Documentation Generator

### [View the Docs!](http://bountysource.github.io)

This client-side application reads the [RAML](http://raml.org)
description of Bountysource's API and creates a more readable
overview.

### Contributing to the Doc Generator

To develop this project locally, clone it and run

```sh
npm install -g bower
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can use a server other than Python if you prefer. It
merely serves the contents of the directory as a static site.

There are several ways you can help. To learn more see the
project issues page.

### Contributing to the API

Would you like to see changes in the API? Send a pull request with
updates to the RAML definition and Bountysource engineers will
discuss it with you and implement your suggestions.

**TODO:** provide the RAML in a public repo to receive these
pull requests. Could be this repo, although I see this as more
of a place for the doc generator itself.
