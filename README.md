To develop this project locally, clone it and run

```sh
npm install -g bower
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can use a server other than Python if you prefer. It
merely serves the contents of the directory as a static site.

There are several ways you can help. To learn more see the
[project issues](issues) page.
